</ul>

<h2>My Graphics Card</h2>
<p>Recently I have gotten a 1660 ti graphics card for my pc. This has been one of the best investments of my life. Everything is so much better now and every game feels so much better. I can run so many of my games at 144 frames and play on the better side of graphics.</p>

<h2> Epic Games Launcher</h2>
<p> So the Epic Games Laucher had been giving out so many free games over the past year. Some of them arent very good but some are amazing. They give out $60 games for free. I have been accumilating many games over this year and have gotten many that I have enjoyed playing. </p>

<h2>Anime</h2>
<p>So far this year I've watcched many animes that I enjoyed. One of them being Full Metal Brotherhood. Another being Cuunbiyou. There are a lot of others I can mention but it will take too long to mention all of them. I've been meaning to read up on some manga but never got to it.</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>There are a lot of games I have gotten into in the past year. The list goes, GTA V, I jsut started playing this when it came out in the Epic Launcer for free. I played on my PS4 but have moved on onto my PC. I've put almost 100 hours into the game since ive gotten, which has been about a week and a half. Another game is CSGO, which I enjoy playing becuase I play with friends and gget to climb the skill ladder as I go. I am currently Gold Nova 1 and deranked from Gold Nova 2. The last game I am going to mention is Minecraft. Ive been playinig on Hypixel Skyblock for a while. Some games that came out were Minecraft Dungeons and the new terrraria update. One was fun and another was a let down.</p>

<h2>My AC</h2>
<p>I just got an AC and this weather sucks. It's nice to have a cool room in this heat. One of the best things my parents have gotten me. </p>

<h2>Weight and Grades</h2>
<p>Recently I have been on a diet with my Uncle. He convinced me to go on it last december and I got to it. In total I've lost 60 pounds and am still going through it. I want to lose more and plpan to keep going for a lot longer. For my grades, I've been getting suprisingly good grades for someone who does his homework barelly before the due date, ie. this assignment. But recently, I have gotten As for all my classes this year and hope this continues, though, I do have Adv, Phys next year, which will probably ruin that for me.</p>
