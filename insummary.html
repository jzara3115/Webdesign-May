<h2>What I Thought Was Going to Happen</h2>
<p>When I signed up for this class, I knew nothing about it. I only knew that it was going to teach me web development and help me expand on my coding skills. I was already taking classes d.tech offered in web design burt I thought this class would go deepper. I was hoping for more proper techniques for coding.</p>

<h2>Why I Chose This Class</h2>
<p>I signed up for this class in the beggining of this school year. I decided to take this class for my VAPA and get it done. I ended up enjoying it a lot as it lets you have as muych creative freedom you want. It feels nice to make a website and just do whatever you want with it. More or less. I chose this class to expand on my skills in web development and in coding in general. </p>
