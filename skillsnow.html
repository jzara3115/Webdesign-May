<h2>My Skills Now</h2>
<p>My skills now have significantly improved many things in my coding  and gaming life. After upgrading my computer and being able to do whatever I wanted, I started to play better games that had higher skill caps. I started to create websites on my own with no help whatsoever. I now know the basics and can make a relatively good website if I really wanted to. I also learned how to use github and how to utilize it to my advantage. I figured out that github works wonders and helps a lot of people save their work and publish it. Including me. I learned tricks and techniques for coding that I use now. I have grown in my knowledge of code a decent amount. I want to learn more though. I wwant to be able to use cloud data to my advantage and really utilize other things besides css and html in my websites.</p>
