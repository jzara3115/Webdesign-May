<h2>My Skills Then</h2>
<p>My skills werent very impressive then. I did not know hot to do a single bit of code to get a website working. I knew the bare bone basics thanks to my web design class in d.tech, but even then all I had was html knowledge and only p tags memorized. The only thing I did with computers was browse the internet and play the really easy games such as stardew valley (which I still love to this day). I did play a little bit of fps but that was on my PS4. If I ever did play on my pc, it was Rainbow Six Siege with some of my friends. All in all, I wasnt very handy when it came to computers. Although I did love them and wanted to do more with them. What I thought was that making games was cool and I have tried many times with my mac, which didnt go so well.</p>
