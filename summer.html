<h2>Animes Coming Out</h2>

<h3>Fire Force Season 2:</h3>
<img class="animeimage" src="images/anime1.png">
<p>I jsut recently saw the first season and thought it was pretty good. The second season will come out with a lot more content I want to see and I am excited to see how it goes, especially after how the first season ended.</p>

<h3>Re:Zero Season 2:</h3>
<img class="animeimage" src="images/anime2.png">
<p>The first season was one of the first animes I've watched. I thouroughly enjoyed it and am very excited to see the second season come out. In the mean time I was watching Isekai Quartet to see the characters again, even if it is meant to be a comedy and non-canon</p>

<h3>My Teen Romantic Comedy Season 3:</h3>
<img class="animeimage" src="images/anime3.png">
<p>This is honestly one of the genres I take guilty pleasures in. The first 2 seasons were really good in my eyes and I am excited to see where it ends. It sucks knowing this is where it ends but it was a good show throughout the whole thing.</p>

<h2>Games Coming Out</h2>

<h3>Death Stranding</h3>

<p>It may seem like it's already a game over for this, but I still have hope. I really hope it does turn out to be a very beautiful game and that it can pprovide fantastic scenery and visuals. Thats all im riding on at this point. I'm hoping this can be a lo-fi game where I can just sit down and enjoy the ride. </p>
<h3>Marvel's Iron Man VR</h3>

<p>I have a psvr headset and am looking forward to sitting down and just flying. Nothing special to this game. Thats all im looking forward to. Only becuase a PSVR is the only headset I will probably ever get.</p>
<h3>Valorant</h3>
