<h2>My Plans for Summer if Quarantine is Over</h2>
<p>Honestly, this is probably the least possible case. I dont think we'll end quarantine by then. But by the offchance that we do, this is what I would probably do to get it over. Since I live in Redwood City, I am sure I would spend most of my time outside (if i even go outside) downtown with a few friends of mine. Other than that, I guess I would spend a loit of time with family and hang out with them. Besides the obvious anime watching and gaming, thats about all I would do during summer. It would be nice to go to the beach or go to Mexico, which is somewhere my family would probably take me. During summer, my birthday occurs, so I will probably be doing something for that. I dont know what but something will happen, maybe a new game or something? Who knows.</p>

<h2>My Summer Plans if Quarantine is Still Active</h2>
<p>If summer is still affected by COVID-19, I will probably be doing a lot lazier things than I am now, which is pretty lazy to start off with. To be fair, not a lot of new things are coming out that is worth waiting for. So I will peobably just be layin in my bed, watching anime or Youtube. There are plenty of anime I havent watched yet and am excited to see many anime that I missed out on. I have hundreds lined up for watching. I would also be in Algebra 2 classes that I will hopefully pass. I am not the best at math so I will need to spend a lot of time understanding the subject so I can pass. Thats all my schedule would be lined up with, not much but stuff for school and anime.</p>
