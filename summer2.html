<h1>Game Idea 1:</h1>
<p>It is a really simple rythm based game where you need to use arrow key/ wasd to point your character in the right way. Pellets are going to be coming out of the side of the screens going towards the middle and you need to keep them from touching you. They come in depending on the rythm and beat the song is in. It is really simple and I hope I can make something out of it durting the summer. I hope to be working in unity and make it 2D. </p>

<h1>Game Idea 2:</h1>
<p>This one is more for school but it is our homeless game we worked on last intersession. Just make decisions and hope it turns out ok to get out of poverty. Just a click and adventure game, but this time in Unity to make it play better. There isn't much else but we hope to make it high quality enough that we can call it our own. Our child. It is mainly for innovation diploma and helping poverty in the Bay Area.</p>
