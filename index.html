<h1> May 26</h1>
<p>Day 1: Github takes a while to get the website up. This kinda sucks. I did get it working though. Which for now is all I need. Also got the color scheme I like the most, which is dark grey background with white letters. Very basic and simple. Nice. There arent may things I've done during qurabntine besides play a lot of video games.</p>
<h1>May 27</h1>
<p>Im starting to dislike this font more and more as I go on. It doesnt exactly look good, at all. Too blocky for my style and everything looks like it is bold. It kinda reminds me of the meme font that you used to see on the meme pictures.</p>
